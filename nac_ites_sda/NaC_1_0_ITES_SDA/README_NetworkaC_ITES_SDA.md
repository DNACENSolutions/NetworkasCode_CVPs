                <code>- Key Steps:</code><br>
                <code>  #Step1: <b>IP Pool Reservation</b>  An L3 IP pool is assigned to the site specifically for the dedicated C2S VPN gateway and associated Anycast Gateway. This pool is exclusive to a specific VPN domain and its clients.</code><br>
                <code>  #Step2: <b>L3 VN + Anycast Gateway Creation</b> A new L3 virtual network is created and bound to the site along with its Anycast Gateway configuration. This forms the data plane for C2S remote clients.</code><br>
                <code>  #Step3: <b>Device Role Assignment</b>  Fabric devices (e.g., border/edge) are assigned their roles for this newly created VN. The dedicated firewall is linked as the only upstream security device, enforcing full traffic isolation.</code><br>
                <code>  #Step4: <b>Wired Host Onboarding</b> Wired clients are onboarded into the new virtual network. The path from remote user → VPN → dedicated firewall → onboarded device is validated end-to-end.</code><br><br>
                <code>⚠️ <b>Key Distinction from Shared Firewall:</b></code><br>
                <code> In this use case, the firewall is dedicated: only one IP pool and one client context is used, ensuring exclusive traffic segmentation.</code><br>
                <code> In a shared firewall setup (as handled in a different use case), multiple pools may route through a single firewall, requiring logical separation via VRFs or ACLs.</code><br>
                <code>💡 <b>Use Case Applicability:</b> </code><br>
                <code>  Ideal for high-security organizations (e.g., financial institutions, government) requiring strict separation of VPN access paths without overlap across clients or business units.</code></td>

                functional validation and continuous integration.</code><br><br>
                <code>⚠️ Key Difference from Dedicated Firewall:</code><br>
                <code> In this shared firewall model, a single firewall instance handles multiple client IP pools with logical isolation enforced through VRFs and access policies. It is ideal for ITES operations managing multiple clients from the same infrastructure, offering operational efficiency with shared security resources.</code><br><br>
                <code>💡 Use Case Example:</code><br>
                <code> An ITES provider delivering customer service for multiple domains (e.g., telecom, e-commerce, insurance) can use a shared firewall to enable secure C2S VPN access for remote agents, while maintaining separation via VRFs and ACLs instead of physical firewalls.</code></td>

                Key Design Characteristic:<br>
                The L2 handoff path connects the dedicated firewall to the Border node through a single VLAN<br>

                ⚠️Difference from Shared Firewall Variant:<br>
                Unlike the shared firewall scenario (where multiple VLANs are trunked to the Border for different clients),<br>
                this setup uses a single VLAN mapped to one specific service context. Logical isolation is not needed,<br>

                Security Advantage:<br>
                Since traffic doesn't leave the fabric for policy enforcement, latency is reduced and audit<br>
