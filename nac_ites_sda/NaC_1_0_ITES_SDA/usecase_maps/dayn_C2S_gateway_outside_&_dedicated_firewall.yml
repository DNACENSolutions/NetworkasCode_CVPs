# Difference: Client-to-Site VPN with Gateway Outside Fabric — Dedicated vs Shared Firewall

# ➤ Overview:
# In both setups, the remote user connects to the firewall gateway (located outside the fabric).
# The VPN tunnel terminates at the firewall, and traffic is then forwarded into the fabric 
# via handoffs (typically through Layer 2 VLANs extended to the Border node).

# -----------------------------------------------
# 1. Dedicated Firewall:
# -----------------------------------------------
# - One-to-one mapping: One client/IP pool per firewall.
# - Single VLAN for handoff to Border (e.g., VLAN 100).
# - Simplified routing and policy control.
# - Higher isolation and security.
# - Used by enterprises needing strict separation (e.g., BFSI sector).

# Example:
# - Remote user → VPN → Dedicated Firewall → VLAN 100 → Border → Fabric → Application.

# -----------------------------------------------
# 2. Shared Firewall:
# -----------------------------------------------
# - Many-to-one mapping: Multiple clients/IP pools share the same firewall.
# - Multiple VLANs extended to Border (e.g., VLAN 100 for Client A, VLAN 200 for Client B).
# - Requires logical isolation (VRFs, policies).
# - More scalable, cost-effective for MSPs or multi-tenant setups.
# - Each VLAN is mapped to a different VRF or service instance.

# Example:
# - Remote user A → VPN → Shared Firewall → VLAN 100 → Border → VRF-A → Fabric → App-A
# - Remote user B → VPN → Shared Firewall → VLAN 200 → Border → VRF-B → Fabric → App-B

# ➤ Key Difference:
# - Dedicated: Single VLAN, exclusive traffic flow.
# - Shared: Multiple VLANs, shared hardware, logically isolated flows.

# ➤ Design Note:
# - In both cases, L2 VLAN(s) are trunked to Border(s), and L3 handoff to fabric happens via SVI interfaces or routed links.
