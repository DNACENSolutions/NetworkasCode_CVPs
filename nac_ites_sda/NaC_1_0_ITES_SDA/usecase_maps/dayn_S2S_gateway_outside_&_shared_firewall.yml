# Difference: Site-to-Site VPN with Gateway Outside Fabric — Dedicated vs Shared Firewall

# ➤ Overview:
# In S2S VPN, two branch sites are connected securely via a tunnel (IPSec/GRE).
# The firewall gateway at the hub (data center) terminates the tunnel outside the fabric.
# Post decryption, traffic is forwarded into the SDA fabric via Border handoff (usually L2 VLANs).

# -----------------------------------------------
# 1. Dedicated Firewall:
# -----------------------------------------------
# - Each branch site has a unique firewall (or a unique tunnel on a shared firewall).
# - Only one IP pool and one VLAN is used per tunnel (e.g., VLAN 300 for Branch A).
# - Offers isolation per site — fewer shared resources.
# - Easier to monitor and control access per branch.

# Example:
# - Branch A Router → IPSec Tunnel → Dedicated Firewall → VLAN 300 → Border → Fabric → App Server.

# -----------------------------------------------
# 2. Shared Firewall:
# -----------------------------------------------
# - Multiple branch sites terminate tunnels on the same firewall.
# - Each branch's decrypted traffic is mapped to a **different VLAN** (e.g., VLAN 300, 301, 302...).
# - Logical isolation is done via policies or VRFs on the fabric side.
# - Efficient and scalable for deployments like MSPs managing many branch clients.

# Example:
# - Branch A → Tunnel → Shared Firewall → VLAN 300 → Border → VRF-A → App-A
# - Branch B → Tunnel → Shared Firewall → VLAN 301 → Border → VRF-B → App-B

# ➤ Key Difference:
# - Dedicated: One VLAN and tunnel per site, higher security, isolated flows.
# - Shared: Multiple VLANs, tunnels, and IP pools coexist — separation is logical.

# ➤ Design Note:
# - Just like C2S, here too L2 VLAN(s) are handed off to Border devices.
# - From Border onward, traffic is routed inside fabric based on VRF/IP pool.
